  Is it possible to have an offer file that does "I offer 2 XCH for either nft123 or nft234 or nft345".
  Or is this just 3 separate offer files on the same 2 XCH coin(s) -- and leave it to the DEX to consolidate them in the UI?
moto:
  The Chia GUI won‚Äôt actually allow you to create three offers against the same coins, i believe? Though I‚Äôve been told it is possible from the command line
jonawan:
  yeah you could do it via CLI, but wondering if it could exist within a single offer file -- maybe not with current implementation but is it possible?
moto:
  I‚Äôve been thinking about a similar problem, say I want to offer 2 XCH for any Chia Friend that‚Äôs a marmot. No broccoli, no bird, no timelord, only marmot. Could be the coolest marmot, could be the lamest marmot, I‚Äôm offering 2 XCH.
  This seems like too much logic to ask from the L1 offer file mechanism. But that‚Äôs why we have layers, so let‚Äôs talk about the next one up!
  L1 offers are a fine primitive, but they don‚Äôt support very smooth price discovery
  So. I started my career working on XMPP, multi-user chat servers, peer-to-peer messaging. It‚Äôs perhaps not surprising that when I think about how I‚Äôd design a L2 for more complex offers, I‚Äôll think about it in terms of a multi-participant chat service
  Now, with all the different NFTs and CATs and what not being developed, I think maybe the best broker for Chia Friends is not going to be the same party as the best broker for Moto Friends.
  In other words: I would like to see it be easy to develop new agents, specializing in particular varieties of NFT for instance, that facilitate these complex queries of the market
  This is the key insight I want to share. A messaging protocol for Offers, one that‚Äôs got an easy-to-integrate software library, is the thing that really is going to make the capital start pumping in these new markets.
  So, here‚Äôs an overview of SSB. I will be reading it with our decentralized exchange use case in mind. commenting as I have thoughts. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357150.3357396

jonawan:
  (re:moto)
  this can be accomplished by a wallet... select all the marmot NFTs and generate a big offer file with the same 2XCH coin to be traded with a list of NFTs. in concept this is the same as many separate offer files
  and it can be done today on CLI -- but it would be up to Dexie to know to combine together offers that have the same input coins
  i'm wondering if it's possible to do it within a single offer file

moto:
  (re: jonawan) I‚Äôm pretty sure I understand what it is you‚Äôre asking for, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not practical on L1, but I‚Äôd really like to figure out how to make an L2 that‚Äôs as open as possible to new participants
  What I‚Äôm imagining is a chat protocol, multi-user rooms where you can express an interest in buying something in a more complex / fluent fashion than Offer files alone allow.
  It would be natural for folks to build bots around those offer-solicitation channels, to provide better brokerage services for more discerning markets
  One which would allow you to send a well-formed message like
  WANT: [nftxyz | nftabc | nftzyx] OFFER: [1000000 SBX ; 0.22 MRMT]
  Then anyone who had those NFTs would be notified of your offer.
  But it could get annoying if someone abused that system, making absurdly low offers - I‚Äôd want a way to block people
  So once again I come back to SSB, which is based around subscribing to updates from trustworthy parties. You can also block messages from any unwelcome party.
  In this SSB-based Uberdex, brokers of various assets on the Chia blockchain would run SSB ‚Äúpub‚Äù nodes, and publish their pub‚Äôs connection information widely.
  Each broker‚Äôs Pub would be a place for traders to gather and negotiate a market. Initially at least, traders are humans, swapping offer files and keeping track of who wants what NFT via handwritten notes.
  We‚Äôre already at this stage of evolution, sorta. Discord is awful, but it‚Äôs popular.
  I think that maybe if we could nudge new projects towards using SSB, things might consolidate and automate a lot more easily
trepca:
  So users would be sending offer files to brokers that would distribute them to their subscribers?
moto:
  Uh, not quite ‚Ä¶
  In the system I‚Äôm proposing, L1 Offer files don‚Äôt get generated until the very last stages of finalizing a sale transaction
  First I have to tell people I‚Äôm interested in buying Marmot Gene. Otherwise, the current owner of that NFT might never know the riches I can offer.
  So folks who are interested in selling their Chia Friends, maybe they go to a pub where folks interested in buying Chia Friends state what they‚Äôre willing to pay, and using that information, the prospective seller can post an offer with a strong expectation it‚Äôll be promptly accepted
  Likewise prospective buyers could see what others have paid historically, by viewing the history of public trade information which the pub serves as a sort of hub / repository for.
  For sufficiently vibrant markets, bots could watch the pub for ‚Äúgood deals‚Äù and keep inventory, ready to satisfy any buyer‚Äôs wishes with the fastest Offer out there.
  Okay, I'm thinking about starting a CHIP. A Decentralized Trading Protocol. Before I get too deep, what prior art is there?
  Quite a few protocols out there, actually. This is going to take some collaboration.
  Pillar. OUCH. FIX. Fun.
  oye. okay, maybe we crib a base feature set based on a survey of existing platforms. Maybe in the morning, after an episode of Venture Brothers.
  A CHIP is born. I've named it the CHia Offer Message Protocol: https://github.com/CommanderMoto/chips/blob/main/CHIPs/chip-moto-offer-message-protocol.md
acevail:
  Nice, I just thought about a peer to peer offer trading protocol the last couple of days!
  I'd love to help figuring out how to CHOMP

(#redacted)
moto:
  y'all are still awfully focused on web-browser-based experiences. I still am interested in something more like a messaging app, using a financial information exchange format akin to the ones used by present-day fiat-based exchanges
riches:
  yo, get your CHIP PRed then we will all talk about nothing else üòé
moto:
  I'll admit it. I have a well-formed idea inside my head, but serializing it for transmission to other people is something I am still struggling with
  I would be infinitely grateful for any authorial assistance
roybot:
  Have you heard of Mixin? https://mixin.one/
moto:
  As of about 30 seconds ago üòÇ
  [time passes]
    okay, I have finally forced myself to spend enough time looking at mixin.one to feel comfortable saying: I desperately want to look away. Architecturally speaking, mixin.one looks like a monolithic monster and the opposite of what I want üòÇ
    I won't rule out the possibility that there's something they're (mixin.one) doing that's worth learning from, but ... if so, I'll need you to point it out to me
riches:
  the main question it raises for me is how much data you want to be able to put into the message. NFTs are a good example - would you want to retrieve some info from the NFT's off-chain metadata (like the NFT's name) to put into the message? or limit it to info only available to a chia wallet take_offer -e?
  the former would work fine if the messages are going to be mainly generated by wallets
  the latter would be more portable, so a messaging app for example could switch message formats without having to look all that data up
moto:
  The protocol I have in mind would use an optional / extensible query syntax for price inquiries
  And price inquiries may be used as a prompt for brokers to generate Offers. The Buyer is responsible for inspecting any Offers that they receive in response to a Query
  I may ask for pricing on marmots and you return an offer for parrots. That‚Äôs permissible.
riches:
  so the broker is just a message relay? they don't actually enforce anything
moto:
  Basically, chia_offers#offer-trading is the model I‚Äôm using; I just want to make it easier for bots to know what‚Äôs been offered and what‚Äôs wanted in the market
  In this model, a ‚ÄúBroker‚Äù is any agent who is looking at Price Checks and occasionally posting Offers
  Presumably our broker has an inventory of assets which they are exposing to the market
riches:
  is there no necessity for the message format to be at all human readable then?
  if people are expected to interact via bots or extensions to messaging apps
moto:
  Actually that‚Äôs the exact reason I wanted to use JSON. Automated brokers should be able to parse it just as easily as the humans who‚Äôll be the first brokers in the next hot new NFT market
  I imagine there will be websites like Dexie which connect to the CHOMP chat rooms and continue providing the same services you‚Äôd expect. The key though is that the messaging, the market is wide open to everyone. No crypto.com-style customer silos.
  Someone in the local Merrill Lynch office has a connection to NYSE that they send this sort of order information through. I want that to be an open network and an open protocol, as opposed to the web of proprietary stuff that‚Äôs called ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù
altdenky:
  wouldn't they just download every posted offer and process it?  where any adjacent data that is 'easier' to parse would be an optimization, and a means to hide things as well.
  you are talking about wanting a thing to be able to see all the offer information and there seemed to be discussion about serialization formats and such.  but it seems like we already have that.  offer files.  just make them accessible to everyone in any way that allows all parties to be notified.
moto:
  gotcha. What I'm proposing, actually, is a price discovery mechanism with less commitment, and therefore (I presume) more liquidity; the Offer Files may be submitted to the comms channel with as much or as little human-readable context as we decide makes sense
  Presently you have to know exactly which NFT you're shopping for, look up the owner, try to contact them, get an offer worked out - this communication protocol is meant to formalize that process


(#dev)
moto:
  so a messaging format is just the first proposal in my master plan, which is to convince y'all to add an optional Decentralized Exchange module into the complement of Chia daemons.
  this way when you're looking at the assets in your Chia wallet, there's an option to look up their live value on the market, against whatever trading pair you want
altdenky:
  looking for a parallel gossiping protocol for 'exchange' data?
  *parallel to the existing blockchain protocol
moto:
  Basically yeah
  L1.5-ish
  the offers are executed on L1, but there's higher-level communications that lead to that finalization
  I will tip my hand and confess I have a fondness for the architecture of SSB. I worry it might not be a practical / performant option for our purposes, and I think that's worth discussing.
  * as that transport-layer communication protocol - the daemon that "chia start dex" fires up
altdenky:
  what would get propagated other than the offer file?
moto:
  Well, in the decentralized exchange I'm imagining, you want a way to ask the market what's for sale without making an offer. Soliciting offers.
altdenky:
  wouldn't that just would that be a matter of receiving all the submitted offers?  basically a mempool equivalent for offers and when you join the p2p network you bring your 'mempool' up to sync as other nodes gossip to you
moto:
  You describe the asset you want, including some sort of extensible metadata query language plugin [INCOMPLETE] - published into a feed
  subscribers to that feed, if they have what you want, can reply into the same feed with Offer files
altdenky:
  is that not you submitting an offer from the other direction?
moto:
  anybody in the feed can snatch an Offer that's been made - the price is now public knowledge
  finer-grained liquidity
altdenky:
  if you want to buy xch using your sbx, you can look for existing offers to sell xch for sbx or submit your offer to buy xch using sbx.
moto:
  for more fungible assets, I understand and agree that the mechanism, as designed, still seems like it ought to work, once we reach some volume. But NFTs, man.
  I want a gold timelord or a blue marmot. I have 10XCH to spend. No matching NFT is presently offered for sale, but also it's really difficult for owners of those NFTs to know their market value.
altdenky:
  you want to be able to say 'i will pay 3xch for any nft by did ABC in collection XYZ'?
  mm, i haven't worked on the chialisp side but i think this is exactly why some of the metadata is on chain.
moto:
  right, I want to have a communications channel where those sorts of more-complex offers can be described and negotiated, above the L1
altdenky:
  i don't think the 'blue marmot' level is though.  i think that's the off-chain metadata
moto:
  the object being, I say "I want a blue marmot or a yellow parrot and I'll pay 10 XCH" -> owners of blue marmot and yellow parrot NFTs can see, in their NFT wallet, in the "price history" graph, that there was a relevant sale at some point in the past
  this is a decentralized financial messaging protocol that's "only" using Chia Offers to consummate the transactions
  yes: this sort of sophisticated price history - at the wallet level - is at present primarily a function offered by sites offering centralized exchange services
  Read up on SSB. The doc I linked is probably too deep a dive, actually; let me see if I can find a friendlier intro
altdenky:
  so a mempool of these more flexible offers based on off-chain data.  monitoring of the chain for any completed transactions identifiable as 'trades' (just completed on-chain offers i guess, at least to start).  some tooling for searching and filtering the mempool.  maybe automated on-chain concrete offer creation.
  to make it generic we need a schema for the off-chain data on which you can operate.  i think chip7 has an option for that.
moto:
  a bit higher-level, overview includes key concept of "pubs": https://scuttlebot.io/more/protocols/secure-scuttlebutt.html
  Brokers and pubs seem to map very well to one another. A broker maintains an inventory and has an interest in collecting price information which they can then use to make offers based on their inventory
altdenky:
  i'm all for existing tooling.  in this case we have some in-project existing tooling.  (presuming you think about it in terms of being in chia-blockchain which i'm not saying it would or should be there, but...)  so what does ssb bring instead of another instance of the mempool idea and existing gossiping etc.
moto:
  totally valid question. The crucial thing that SSB offers is SNR control. A Pub operator has complete control over what feeds they subscribe to. Feeds are associated with decentralized identities.
  So it becomes very simple to notice a bad actor flooding your pub with bogus price inquiries and boot 'em. They can still inquire elsewhere, they just can't ask you.
altdenky:
  i guess right now in terms of the transaction mempool that is only done at the peer level.  not the data level.  other than simply invalid transactions.
moto:
  right. And the mempool isn't very robust *as performant as I'd like - bwfree and I were able to visibly impact it with some nearly-free commandline fuckery
  SSB is designed around the assumption that there are bad actors and good actors and you wanna block the one and propagate the other
  but crucially, nobody has to agree on who's bad or who's good, because those decisions are made at the individual level
altdenky:
  well, the distinction i see is that you don't ignore bad peers but rather ignore bad offer originators.  (i mean sure, also bad peers but...)
  right now when we gossip along a tx we don't include the originator of the tx.  just the tx itself.  so i guess you could adjust the code to block a configurable source or destination tx list.  but with the default of a new address per tx, that doesn't do a whole lot.
moto:
  so ... yeah, I posit the need for a trading layer, with ID-based controls to filter signal from noise while still facilitating rich data collection
  SSB is a long-term goal, though. In the immediate term, let's work out what the trading messages look like; we'll debate the message transport layer after we've got the message format sorted.
altdenky:
  how do you avoid bad sources id hopping?
moto:
  well, that's a problem that I intend for SSB to address, but again, I think the first goal should be to define what well-formed financial information queries look like
altdenky:
  i guess there's a form for xch/cats and a form for nfts.  the nft form would allow for whatever constraints are sensible based on the schema.  you can make constraints on any field the schema allows and if it's numeric then stuff like > < ==.  for strings you might have substring etc.
moto:
  I'm hoping that the messaging format will offer utility on its own. For instance, the official Chia Wallet currently gives the option to post offer files to a couple of select exchanges.
  What I don't have, aside from the little bit I (or more likely, some website operator) can deduce from monitoring the mempool, is any way of knowing what my various assets are worth in terms of trading pairs.
  So another way of looking at this is, we're using this extra layer of trading messages to offer the market better price intelligence
altdenky:
  i think the conclusion was that we can identify the result of offer files on chain.  so i think the chain still offers the history.  but this layer offers the ...  i don't know the terminology.  the spread maybe?
moto:
  We're both at a loss for the proper term. But yeah - the more liquid the asset, the less utility offered by this additional price intelligence
  On the other hand, for something illiquid like an NFT in a crowded market, this might be the only way to build price intelligence about your one-of-a-kind thingamabob
jeffmthomas:
  A friend and I are working on an NFT browser for Chia & its forks.  We are hoping to provide the community with a real time complete database of ALL NFT's on the blockchain.
moto:
  Well sir, I would like to chat with you about a little Electronic Trading Data format which I think you‚Äôd find interesting
  CHOMP is an idea meant to facilitate price discovery, and the service you describe seems like one that folks will definitely want trading data from
  I‚Äôm not a domain expert in trading, but I do have quite a bit of experience with decentralized / federated communication networks
jeffmthomas:
  Interestingly, We have been trying to figure out the best way to propagate DEX offers and trading into our system.
  I am still trying to figure out how to decode whether an NFT was:
  a.) Transferred to another address without an offer
  b.) Transferred to another address as an accepted offer
  c.) Part of an offer that was cancelled

  I have noticed a couple of things just browsing through the database:
  1.) There are 3 initial coin spends on the same block for every NFT minted.
  2.) When an NFT coin is spent, there are either 1 or 2 coin spends in the same block for each NFT.
  3.) I am for now assuming that spends back to the original puzzlehash are coming from cancelled offers (where else would they come from?)
moto:
  Alright, I'm calling it. There is substantial community interest, so where's our DEX working group?
  Instead of a few gatekeepers paying for access to NYSE / NASDAQ terminals, Chia + ( decentralized ID | secure scuttlebutt ) gives us the primitives we need for everyman to connect direct to the Big Exchange In The Sky and perform the exact same operations - with trustless transactions replacing expensive and unreliable humans
  we just need message formats. transport layers. I know a few things about these.
  a clever protocol design will include some mechanism for compatibility with FIX, which I've gathered is the old-guard industry standard
jeffmthomas:
  OK I like where you are going
  We definitely need a better way for offers to become available to users (and I really like what I read about SSB).
moto:
  And there‚Äôs also demand from people who want to ‚Äútalk about‚Äù trades in ways that are more complex than L1 permits. Specifying a user‚Äôs interest in pricing for an NFT matching specific attributes, for instance.
  SSB also could facilitate useful alignments with one‚Äôs DID wallet, being itself an identity-oriented (messaging | public blockchain database) protocol
